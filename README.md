# 🧠 Mental Health Prediction Using NLP  
📌 *Master’s Dissertation Project – Data Science*

---

## 📖 Project Overview

Mental health disorders such as depression and anxiety are often underdiagnosed due to social stigma and lack of early detection. With the rapid growth of social media, individuals increasingly express emotions and mental states through text.

This project leverages **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Machine Learning** techniques to predict mental health conditions from text data. The work demonstrates an **end-to-end data science pipeline**, from data preprocessing to model deployment, and forms part of my **Master’s Dissertation in Data Science**.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Analyze textual data for mental health indicators  
- Perform NLP-based text preprocessing  
- Handle class imbalance using SMOTE  
- Train and compare multiple ML models  
- Evaluate models using standard metrics  
- Deploy the best-performing model using Pickle
